## Hi!

I am a PhD student in the [Active Sensing](https://www.bi.mpg.de/fenk) research group at the [Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence](https://www.bi.mpg.de/en). My work in [Dr. Lisa Fenk's](https://www.bi.mpg.de/2401722/fenk-page.html) group is broadly centered on mechanisms of distance estimation in _Drosophila melanogaster_, figuring out how flies use their newly discovered ability to [move their retinae](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05317-5) to percieve depth during natural behaviours. Before starting my PhD, I completed the integrated BS-MS dual-degree program at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research [IISER](https://www.iiserpune.ac.in/) Pune, India. For my master's thesis, I worked on fruit fly escape behaviour with [Dr. Gwyneth Card](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/gwyneth-card-phd) at Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute.

As a neuroethologist, I have a lasting admiration for the richness of physiology and behavior across nervous systems during natural behaviors. An interest in the "[Krogh-ian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krogh%27s_principle)" approach has allowed me to have a diverse background in neuroscience, from songbirds and fruit flys to in-silico cells. This broad background has made me particularly partial to invertebrates because they exhibit an enormous diversity of complex behaviors with relatively "simple" brains, making it easier to understand circuit dynamics. I have settled on working with fruit flies (_Drosophila melanogaster_) for my PhD since I have found them to be an excellent balance between accessibility (in terms of the extremely powerful genetic toolkit available) and novelty in brain architecture and behavior.

In my free time I enjoy solving puzzles, coding and tinkering with toy models, playing squash, and drinking freshly brewed coffee. I also follow motorsport and like reading non-fiction books.
