Recordings in the songbird HVC (the nucleus necessary for song learning and production) and other areas have shown that neural activity when anaethetized birds were played back their own song (known as a BOS, Birds-Own-Song, response) is very similar to activity when the bird is producing song. I studied the encoding of introductory notes in zebra finch vocal nuclei through extracellular recordings during BOS responses, to understand how exactly INs might be produced through neural activity.
