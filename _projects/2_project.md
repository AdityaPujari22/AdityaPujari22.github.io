Escape behaviours are severely time-constrained due to fast predatory strikes. They thus provide a useful model to understand how different behaviour strategies are computed over a limited number of synapses. Broadly, one can propose two general strategies of escape: to escape away from the threat or to escape toward safety. While not mutually exclusive, these two strategies are fundamentally distinct in the computations they require. Escaping toward a safe place has better long-term value but might take up valuable time since it requires complex computations such as evaluating shelter locations and available escape routes. Mice escape directly towards a learned shelter location by encoding a shelter-directed vector in their brain. The proposed model behind this shelter-direction vector is closely related to models of heading direction proposed for various circuits in other animal species, including fruit flies. Over the course of this work I investigated whether fruit flies show shelter directed escape behaviours. I tested multiple shelter designs and found that flies bias their escape trajectory towards shelters, but this bias is weak and, in the short term, does not lead to optimal safety-directed trajectories.
