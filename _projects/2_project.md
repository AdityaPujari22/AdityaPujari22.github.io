Escape behaviours are severely time-constrained due to fast predatory strikes. They thus provide a useful model to understand how different behaviour strategies are computed over a limited number of synapses. Broadly, one can propose two general strategies of escape: to escape away from the threat or to escape toward safety. While not mutually exclusive, these two strategies are fundamentally distinct in the computations they require. Escaping toward a safe place has better long-term value but might take up valuable time since it requires complex computations such as evaluating shelter locations and available escape routes. Mice escape directly towards a learned shelter location by encoding a shelter-directed vector in their brain. The proposed model behind this shelter-direction vector is closely related to models of heading direction proposed for various circuits in other animal species, including fruit flies. Over the course of this work I investigated whether fruit flies show shelter directed escape behaviours. I tested multiple shelter designs and found that flies bias their escape trajectory towards shelters, but this bias is weak and, in the short term, does not lead to optimal safety-directed trajectories.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %} -->
