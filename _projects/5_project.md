A promising approach to cancer treatment is adaptive therapy, which involves incorporating 'drug holidays' in between drug administrations to prevent the tumour from developing resistance. The principle behind this therapeutic method involves competition between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cells keeping the tumour size in check, and killing drug-sensitive cells with high drug doses causes a competitive release of resistant cells leading to a largely drug-resistant tumour.

I built a discrete-time, discrete-space ecological model in order to study the competition for resources and space between cancer cell types. The model can be found [here](https://github.com/AdityaPujari22/Cancer-comp-strat-spatial).
