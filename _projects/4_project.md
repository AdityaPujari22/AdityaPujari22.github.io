Zebra finch song is composed of motifs (groups of repeating vocalisations) and Introductory Notes (INs), which precede the song. Juvenile males learn a song from adult male conspecifics (tutors), and recent work from our lab has shown no correlation between the number and structure (the frequency distribution in the spectrogram of the note) of INs learnt between tutor-tutee pairs. Consequently, we hypothesised that independent neural populations are responsible for learning IN structure and number in the zebra finch brain. I tested this hypothesis by tutoring birds with songs having different IN properties and studying the vocalisations learnt. For this purpose, I designed and built a closed-loop system using an Arduino to detect perch-hopping behaviour by the bird, and a tablet display to provide audio and video playback of a singing adult male. You can read more about this setup [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.02.514933v1).

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %} -->
